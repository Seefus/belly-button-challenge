Module 14 Challenge (Java)
My Instructor Othemane helped me a lot on the buildMetadata function. 

We used stack verflow for the loop inside the buildMetadata functuon. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14379274/how-to-iterate-over-a-javascript-object)

I also used google to find the foreach funtion in the init function to append the sampleNames.

I use the previous homework to help me as well

For trouble shooting I used stack overflow, google and ChatGPT. 2 large issue CHatGPT helped me touble shoot was that my variables were not being defined and as it turned out I need to make sure i was acessing the first element by adding the "[0]" to the end of my filter functions. As well as it caught that I was not unsing the correct varable in my option change function.
